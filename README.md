Lean 4 / Mathlib formalisation of hard attention expressivity over finite Boolean sequences.

The general parity lower bound, `parityN_requires_N_heads` (with `collision_exists_n` and the `parityN` compatibility lemmas), and the windowed lower bound (`ParityWindow`) are proved using only the standard axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`, with no `native_decide`. The enumerated fixed-width results (the `Parity4*` modules and some `Compute` lemmas) additionally use `native_decide`, which introduces the `Lean.ofReduceBool` axiom.

## Theorems proved

| Module | Theorem | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AttentionLean.Defs` | `attentionScore_eq_scoreVal` | The attention score at position `i` is exactly the position-local score value for `x i`. |
| `AttentionLean.Compute` | `argmaxScore_two` | For two positions, deterministic argmax selects position `0` when score `0 >= score 1`, otherwise position `1`. |
| `AttentionLean.Compute` | `headOutput_two` | Unfolds the full two-token hard-attention output into argmax, value read, affine readout, and threshold. |
| `AttentionLean.Compute` | `fin2_bool_forall` | Reduces universal claims about `Fin 2 -> Bool` inputs to the four Boolean cases. |
| `AttentionLean.AndOr` | `and_one_head` | Constructs a single one-dimensional hard-attention head computing Boolean AND on two-bit inputs. |
| `AttentionLean.AndOr` | `or_one_head` | Constructs a single one-dimensional hard-attention head computing Boolean OR on two-bit inputs. |
| `AttentionLean.Xor` | `xor_not_single_head` | Proves no single hard-attention head of any internal dimension computes XOR on two-bit inputs. |
| `AttentionLean.ParityN` | `parityN_requires_N_heads` | **General lower bound (headline).** For every `n` and every `k < n`, no `k` hard-attention heads through a thresholded affine readout compute `parityN`. Axioms: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`, with no `native_decide`. |
| `AttentionLean.ParityN` | `collision_exists_n` | Fewer than `n` fixable head-functions admit an opposite-parity input pair on which all of them agree: the pigeonhole / subcube collision that drives the general bound. |
| `AttentionLean.ParityWindow` | `parityN_requires_window_union` | **Windowed lower bound.** Heads whose argmax provably stays inside windows `W i` cannot compute `parityN` when the windows jointly miss a coordinate (`card (⋃ i, W i) < n`) — with no bound on the number of heads. Incomparable to `parityN_requires_N_heads` (e.g. `n` heads all windowed on one position). Same axioms, no `native_decide`. |
| `AttentionLean.ParityWindow` | `parityN_requires_window_bound` | Corollary of the union bound: `k` heads of window ≤ `t` need `k·t ≥ n`. (This numeric form also follows from `parityN_requires_N_heads`, since `t ≥ 1` forces `k ≤ k·t < n`; it is kept as the readable "heads × window" reading.) |
| `AttentionLean.ParityWindow` | `collision_of_fixableK` | t-coordinate generalisation of the collision lemma: `k` functions, each constant after pinning ≤ `t` coordinates on any subcube (`FixableK`), admit an opposite-parity agreeing pair whenever `k·t` is below the free-coordinate count. `Fixable` embeds at `t = 1` (`fixable_fixableK`). |
| `AttentionLean.Parity4Main` | `parity4_requires_four_heads` | Enumerated `n = 4` case: no 3 heads compute parity on 4 bits. Proved by `native_decide`, so it additionally carries `Lean.ofReduceBool`. |
| `AttentionLean.ParitySmall` | `parity3_requires_three_heads` | Enumerated `n = 3` case: no 2 heads compute parity on 3 bits. Proved by `native_decide`, so it additionally carries `Lean.ofReduceBool`. |
